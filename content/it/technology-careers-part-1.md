**A System Administrator is like a Firefighter** - always available to
fix an emergency, but without the glamour; after putting out a fire a
SysAdmin has to report (with vague implications of guilt): what
happened, why it happened, and how it can be prevented in the future.
(Who's fault is it?)

</p>

Good System Administrators are well paid but usually work on the
invisible and complex "back end" and are on "on call". (Yes, your
dinner, sleep, and other private activities will be interrupted.) A
stable, in demand, career since it's hard to fire a good System
Administrator but there's often a belief that the position could/should
be outsourced. (Ever hear the story of the SysAdmin who was so good at
automating server tasks and desktop deployments that he put himself out
of a job?)

</p>

If you're not careful, methodical, detailed, and cool headed then this
may not be the right path for you. (Cynical is optional but it helps a
lot).

</p>

**An IT Manager is like an Accountant** - always asked to do more with
less. In fairness an IT Manager gets to be more creative (legally) as
innovation and change drive technological efficiency.

</p>

Good IT Managers spend as little time as possible in meetings but can
organize and automate the heck out of everything. Diagrams, Business
Cases, Reporting, Schedules. Not often a hands on role.

</p>

Being in charge of IT resources is well paid and it's a stable career
(you're in charge of the budget, right?) but when "downsizing" occurs
you may be considered an acceptable loss (if you're business cases prove
you've saved/earned enough then it's usually a non issue).

</p>

If you're not good at understanding people or technology (yes you have
to hire/fire people and purchase wisely) then this may not be the right
path for you.

</p>

**A Developer is like an Artist** - eccentric, misunderstood, and
something rare for the Arts, well paid.

</p>

Good Developers understand it's Art with a purpose and apply rigorous
engineering principles to their work (since software runs things like
airplanes and hospitals this is a good thing).

</p>

It's well paid but sometimes unpredictable work (software project done =
goodbye expensive labor), luckily there's an endless demand for the
foreseeable future. (Interestingly it often takes awhile to discover a
"bad" developer and even then employers are reluctant to let them go).

</p>

If you're not creative and logical; unable to unriddle paradoxes (yes
it's a required dependency but no we don't want it), or just don't want
to spend most of your waking hours in front of a screen (human contact
optional), then this might not be the right path for you.
