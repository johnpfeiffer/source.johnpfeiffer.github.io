### Security is risk management

The hundreds of articles about "changing passwords doesn't improve security" are just hype/noise without context.

While "changing the highly complex password every 90 days" is considered inefficient and draconian... 
**But what about at least changing the password once a year?**

While it's likely that an external attacker or disgruntled employee will use a compromised password immediately, it doesn't mean there isn't a good reason to choose a frequency of password change:

    If a sticky note attached to a laptop sold at a garage sale is still valid for the company's online bank account then you're in trouble.

Reduce the risk, have a policy to manage that window of access to something you're comfortable with.

**Dependency Visibility** and the opportunity to improve your infrastructure is well worth the cost of finding every hard coded place that a password is embedded in your organization 

- The password was just changed
- You quickly find something is not working
- You either change the password back or refactor/reorganized and break the dependency

**Far better than:**
- a random event like a forgotten password reset by one individual in the organization
- creates a mystery problem in mission critical systems for everyone else to track down
