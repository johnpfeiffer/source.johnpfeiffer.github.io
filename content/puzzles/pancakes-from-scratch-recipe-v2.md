Stir and then pour in enough milk, while beating vigorously, until the mixture is smooth enough to pour.

Hot frying pan (with oil in the bottom) for about 5 mins a side (hopefully you'll have a hotter frying pan/cooker and it will take less time).

Possible spreads (separate or altogether): Jam, chocolate, honey, cheese with honey, philadelphia cream cheese, feta cheese, fruits, peanut butter, ?
