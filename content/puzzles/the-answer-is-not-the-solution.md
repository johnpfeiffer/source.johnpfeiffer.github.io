Title: The answer is not the solution

Look at the number 5: it can have many of representations: IIIII , 10/2 , 05.00 , 5^1

Those representations are not "wrong", they are all still "5".

When people argue about a solution, they can both be "right", and yet there is a reason to pick one solution over another.

If you are adding incrementally, 5 becoming 6 and then 7 is a complete rewrite, whereas IIIII I  becomes IIIII II is much easier to append.
_(Though it also has a downside of readability at scale ;)_

If you are already starting a problem knowing "10", then "10/2" is a more natural fit.

When you intend to progress to 05.13 and then 05.99 , clearly decimal has its place.

One should be aware that assigning the number 5 to a group of stones has no impact on those stones. Our form does not change their content.

So when you hear of a different solution, rather than assuming someone else is wrong, ask yourself: *does this other representation have a different benefit?*

_Furthermore, when you have cleverly come up with a solution "5", do not mistake that with necessarily changing the world._
