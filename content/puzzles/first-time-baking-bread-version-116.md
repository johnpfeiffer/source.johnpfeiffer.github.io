I can cook pancakes, cookies, and cake even... from the pre-made mixes.

Just add water, eggs,stir, heat in oven, eat...


I've tried making pancakes from scratch (next time I'll post the recipe) with ok results.

My first "bread" attempt didn't actually make dough that you can roll so I'm not sure if it was bread...

Mix the following in a bowl:

- 3 glasses of flour (plain, none of that fancy already mixed stuff for
me!)  
- 1 glass of sugar (granular cane sugar is all I had)  
- 3 tsp of baking soda  
- 4 tsp of salt

Beat the following into a different bowl:

- 2 eggs  
- 1 cup of milk

Then stir the two bowls together until mostly smooth.  

Smear cooking oil in the bottom of a pan (mine was 1/2" by 7" by 9") to prevent sticking.  

Pour the mixture into the pan (not really dough, eh?)

Then I melted enough butter to put a tiny layer on top of everything in the pan (note there was lots of leftover "dough" for a second time on the pan).

Baked at 200 degrees celsius for about 15 minutes then set to cool for another 10 minutes.

VERDICT:  

Light and ok for fluffiness. Good crust. 

Definitely too much baking soda but with apricot jam spread tastes fine. Serves 2-3 (or me over one day).  

Good things: oil on the pan, butter on top, sugar is IMPORTANT.

NEXT TIME I will try halving all of the ingredients, reducing the soda by yet another half tsp, and maybe some more sugar or vanilla/cinnamon.


\*LEGEND  

1 small glass = about 200 ml ... is that a cup? (not quite 236ml...)

ml = milliliter, tsp= teaspoon
