Title: Translate This!

As I can speak bulgarian, french, and english (and almost speak italian and spanish) I realized that having my site entirely in english is limiting it's popularity.

Therefore I recommend the following options to ensure that you can understand life, the universe, and the meaning of happiness:

<http://translate.google.com>

<http://www.babelfish.com>

p.s. the above links will not only allow you to translate a website but you can write emails to people in foreign languages full of computer generated errors, WOW much more efficient!
