# It happens to everyone

I've been through more than four layoffs. Some I delivered, some I narrowly avoided being on the receiving end of. A few I watched from the sidelines as a survivor. None of them were easy. None of them felt routine.

During the "Great Financial Crisis" many companies were suddenly in difficult position. Any startup is a [insert burn rate here] months away from ending. Large companies, even ones seemingly successful and profitable, will have strategic changes.

Even if you haven't personally had it happen, your partner or a family member probably has.


This is hard.

Shock, then denial: "Maybe we don't really need to do this. Maybe Q4 will turn around." 

Then frustration and anger—at the situation, at leadership decisions that got you here, at yourself for not seeing it sooner. 

Then a low period where everything feels heavy and the spreadsheet work feels impossible.

Spend your first 24-48 hours in shock and denial. You can gather data during this time, but don't make final decisions.

Your judgment isn't reliable yet.

The work of the "planning" phase is research and thought expriments.

The "decision" phase is committing.

And "integration" is living with the new org you've built.

Recognize where you are on this curve. It affects your judgment, your patience, and your capacity for the hard conversations ahead.



## Timing and Work Backwards from the Goal

If the problem is bad enough it requires a reduction in force, then waiting months or even weeks is likely not going to improve things.

Urgency doesn't mean reckless. These are some of the most critical, life impacting decisions you will make.

Start with the end: what does the successful organization look like after?

Work backwards from there. Brainstorm broadly.




### What does the Future Org look like?

Don't start from your existing org. Think outside of the box.

Start with: What are the most critical projects that have to continue? What skills/support is needed to achieve that?

Start with the end: what does the successful organization look like after? What domains need to exist? What are the natural boundaries where work resides? Teams that own clear domains can organize and decide with minimal external coordination. Long-term understanding of a problem space—including constraints and previous attempts—increases velocity.

Here's where most RIF guidance fails: it focuses on who to remove rather than what you're building. But Conway's Law teaches us that the software (or product, or service) will mirror the organization that builds it. If you get the org design wrong, you'll build the wrong thing—or build it badly.

A RIF is a forcing function for organizational design. Use it.


Consider the really painful and radical ideas first—sometimes they're right, and dismissing them early limits your options.

Gather data, both objective and subjective.
