# It happens to everyone

I've been through more than four layoffs. Some I delivered, some I narrowly avoided being on the receiving end of. A few I watched from the sidelines as a survivor. None of them were easy. None of them felt routine.

During the "Great Financial Crisis" many companies were suddenly in difficult position. Any startup is a [insert burn rate here] months away from ending. Large companies, even ones seemingly successful and profitable, will have strategic changes.

Even if you haven't personally had it happen, your partner or a family member probably has.


This is hard.

Shock, then denial: "Maybe we don't really need to do this. Maybe Q4 will turn around." 

Then frustration and anger—at the situation, at leadership decisions that got you here, at yourself for not seeing it sooner. 

Then a low period where everything feels heavy and the spreadsheet work feels impossible.

Spend your first 24-48 hours in shock and denial. You can gather data during this time, but don't make final decisions.

Your judgment isn't reliable yet.

The work of the "planning" phase is research and thought expriments.

The "decision" phase is committing.

And "integration" is living with the new org you've built.

Recognize where you are on this curve. It affects your judgment, your patience, and your capacity for the hard conversations ahead.



## Timing and Work Backwards from the Goal

If the problem is bad enough it requires a reduction in force, then waiting months or even weeks is likely not going to improve things.

Urgency doesn't mean reckless. These are some of the most critical, life impacting decisions you will make.

Start with the end: what does the successful organization look like after?

Work backwards from there. Brainstorm broadly.




### What does the Future Org look like?

Don't start from your existing org. Be radical.

What are the most critical projects that have to continue? What skills/support is needed to achieve that?

Start with the end: what does the successful organization look like after? What domains need to exist? What are the natural boundaries where work resides? Teams that own clear domains can organize and decide with minimal external coordination. Long-term understanding of a problem space—including constraints and previous attempts—increases velocity.

Here's where most RIF guidance fails: it focuses on who to remove rather than what you're building. But Conway's Law teaches us that the software (or product, or service) will mirror the organization that builds it. If you get the org design wrong, you'll build the wrong thing—or build it badly.

A RIF is a forcing function for organizational design. Use it.


Consider the really painful and radical ideas first—sometimes they're right, and dismissing them early limits your options.

Gather data, both objective and subjective.

Which 1:1s do you dread? Which do you look forward to? That's emotional data. It's not the decision, but it shouldn't be ignored.

The right team size matters. Less than four is fragile (PTO, sickness, on-call coverage). Greater than ten struggles to focus (mega standups, orthogonal sub-projects). The sweet spot is the "two-pizza team"—six to eight engineers who can deliver a feature autonomously.
If you've been running with teams that grew organically across multiple business lines, you may have products that require four or more teams to coordinate for a single workflow. That's a smell. A RIF is an opportunity to redraw those boundaries—to create teams that can own end-to-end value delivery rather than fragments that require constant coordination.
Work backwards from your business needs. Which domains map to revenue? Which teams have clear identity and purpose? Which are grab-bags of miscellaneous work that nobody fully owns?
The survivors need to form a coherent organization, not just a smaller version of a dysfunctional one.

## Careful Systems


Consider a table of names

Build a matrix of attributes: Disruptive? Least Productive? Needs Skills Development? Requires Disproportionate Manager Energy? Cost?

Try a "safe list" approach—start with the nucleus of your future successful org. Then iterate. Priority stack-rank which attributes matter most; all data is not equal. Sort and re-sort from different angles.
Here's the hard part: try not to involve personal variables. You'll go mad thinking about each person's life consequences. Worse, you likely don't know everyone's full situation. You think Person X has visa issues but don't realize Person Y does too. If you skew for one situation you don't fully understand, you're being unfair to situations you're unaware of.
Company culture fit and future team chemistry matter. The survivors need to pull together and push forward. A technically excellent team that can't collaborate won't save you.

## Frameworks for Evaluations

Jim Collins' criteria from Good to Great is one useful framework:

- How would you feel if the person quit today?
- Do you risk losing others by keeping this person?
- Are there concerns about their values, willpower to get things done, or skills?
- When things go wrong, do they look to blame, or in the mirror to improve? 
- Have they been giving you signals "this is just a job"?
- Do you have them in the right on the bus? Did your bus just get a lot shorter?

> Do not be suprised if you may also be on a list, even if it's not today


## Get Feedback

Bounce ideas off people you can trust with confidentiality. Sometimes saying something out loud reveals whether it's brilliant or terrible. Listen to your instincts—not because they're always right, but because they're telling you something you don't fully understand yet.

Before you finalize anything:
Who will take over the work? Is there an inventory of all responsibilities, special skills, critical external relationships, approvals, codes, and logins? What's your second-tier succession plan—who else might leave afterward?

Consider morale and knock-on effects. Cutting Person A might cause Person B to leave voluntarily. That's a compounding loss you may not recover from.

Are there other positions in the company these people could fill? Trades with other managers? These conversations require discretion but can salvage talent and reduce pain.


# Logistics

After you've made the decision stop "looking for more signs" to confirm or deny it. You've done the work.

Do not tell anyone. Do not change your behavior. You might think a hint or tipoff is kind—it isn't. It creates anxiety without agency. It poisons the remaining time. It may leak and create chaos.

Do be open to a last second new piece of data: someone resigning or terminated, a change in the company's plans or needs.




## Who Knows When

\Figure out when the decision must be made and how quickly after you can deliver the news. The gap should be as short as possible—days

sync with your peers who are planning/executing the changes:
- you're all designing the future successful org
- they're your support group (confidential knowers too)


# Communication Preparation


# Moving Forward


The hardest part will not only be the day of delivery and exits, but the day and week after where you support those who remain
- survivor guilt
- anger, denial, etc
- transparent answers as much as possible

To have a reorg, and then lose the rest of your org, is not the goal.


You may shrink back from having 1:1s and skip levels - both because of hard conversations and feedback, but also because it will hurt to create relationships with people who you might have to let go in the future
Resist the instinct to pull away, yet also avoid throwing yourself into smother people - just keep the same stable professional and compassionate cadence
(People Managers represent both Change and Stability)



# Things learned from the pending reorg

- I should have spotted perf issues earlier (yes there was a lot going on but...)
- When I saw the biz miss - I could have escalated to the CEO (Sep/Oct) and even the Chairman of the Board
- Good to have public OKRs
- Need to react/learn faster when there's a zero
- I should have pushed harder in Sept (Test Reorg) about any other changes necessary; now 2 rounds of layoffs
- speaking of Sept Testing ReOrg, I wish I had pushed for it earlier, like in June
- Succession Planning surveys really help
- Good to have org resilience and overlap and cross training
- Good that teams have clear identity/purpose (clearer where/what maps to next business needs)
- Better if they refresh Purpose every 6 months to highest value things
- Good to have lots of written records of (ownership) productivity: roadmaps, demos, features shipped, deploys/releases, Arch proposals, jira points (percent of team/sprint), github commits/PRs/approvals
- Good to have cost-based modelling of teams, mapped to major business needs/products/features (revenue!)
- Good to have a table of all salaries (and even salary/promo history)
- Need to emphasize promotions means expanded expectations for ICs
- Tighten up Managers accountability for their teams Results
- Learned to grow slower (not "2x in 2022") and instead existing and new hires harder, including exiting those who aren't working out earlier
- Need to give James feedback - VIEW and even delayed COFS/Builder merger was worse than a distraction and expense - an opportunity cost!
- Never brag about how much you have in the bank
- If you do feel compelled to say there's years of funding, definitely take into account debt/funding cliffs, exploding debt, and other financial risks

IF you've decided that it is necessary for the business to make such a dramatic change
- cross check with CFO, Board, etc as this is not a change that can suffer a mistake or miscalculation
- consider bringing Directors or even Managers into the planning
- The time between decision to implementation should be as short as possible: weeks or even days (avoiding leaks, rumors, and zombie motions) - id you're truly making this decision for the right reasons waiting will only make things work (no bag of gold will drop from the sky or other externality to magically solve the problem)

CONFIDENTIAL
from everyone in the company

PLANNING EXECUTING
Prioritize thinking and deciding this before almost anything else - the people impacted deserve the best from you
- this is literally one of the moments where Leadership happens (or doesn't)

If this is a bad enough problem that ReOrg/RIF is the solution, then you need to get the change done as quickly as possible
(i.e. if the business pivots due to missing revenue, delaying weeks won't improve revenue)

Spend the first 24 to 48 hours dealing with the Shock and Denial stages of grief - you can brainstorm and gather data but don't make any decisions

This is a planned project: not ad-hoc nor shoot-from-the-hip not arbitrary
have a business outcome in mind; reorg for a good reason
start with the end and work backwards
brainstorm and be open to a lot of paths and options
- consider the really painful and radical ideas first
- get lots of data, both objective and subjective
- which 1:1s or interactions do you dread? which do you look forward to? (that's emotional data - not the choice but not to be ignored)
- ensure you understand what other people managers, especially those connected to your group, are also doing/planning
have some meetings "off calendar"
use spreadsheet(s) to model future orgs and track names
- be clear: you need a healthy org/team at the end to get results
You can't reorg and RIF your way over and over to success; biz revenue from product/services is how you "win"

Do things Iteratively
- try a "safe list" for the nucleus of your future successful org
- ensure you priority stack rank which attributes are most important; all data is not equal
- sort and resort your data, slice it from different angles
- try to not involve any personal variables because you'll go mad thinking about each person's consequences to these decisions - worse yet you likely don't know every person's story so inevitably it will be biased (you think person X has a visa issue but don't realize person Y has a visa issue)
- company culture fit and future team chemistry is important: the survivors need to pull together and push forward
For those you can talk to about it - bounce ideas; sometimes just saying something out loud will make you realize it's a very good or very bad idea
- listen to your instinct and then find data and ask other people why you feel that way
- this does not mean your instinct is telling you the right decision, but that there's something you don't fully understand or isn't conscious yet

You should already, from mid-years and annual reviews (and even quarterly OKRS) have a clear understanding of their skills and experience, strengths and weaknesses

Matrix of attributes and people:
Disruptive, Least Productive, Needs Skills, Requires Manager Energy, Cost

Are there other positions in the company? 
trades with other managers?

Do have succession plans:
- who is going to take over the work?
- is there an inventory of all work and responsibilities
- special skills?
- critical contacts or external relationships?
- approval, codes, logins, etc?

Consider the morale and knock-on impact - who else may leave after?
- what's the "second tier" succession plan?

Do not ever think this is someone else's responsibility; not making a decision is making a decision
You will need to look every person you let go in the eye and own that you made the decision
(nobody wants to be in the overall situation, but someone has to make the hard decisions)
- ultimately be aware and communicate that this is not a personal and not even a professiobal judgement (not "for cause" or "low perf" exit)
- like passing on a candidate: you believe the future org fits best with only some people (and have a constraint of finance and time/focus)
- be honest with yourself and your leadership that some business mistake(s) likely occurred to get your organization in this spot
- be humble enough to recognize you will make mistakes
- plan ahead how you will support folks who remain
- plan ahead how you will support folks who are leaving - they carry your company's reputation to the outside world

TIMING
Figure out when the decision needs to be made - and how quickly after you can deliver the news
HR should know the exit package and be ready with all of the formalities; this is extenely emotional and a "one-way-door" so not a time for mistakes
Dedicate a whole day to it - nothing else
Give the news on a Friday, or whenever you give the news then immediately offboard those exiting
- Anybody working or still connected after must truly be an exception

Do it all at once: if you have to call that person in the middle of their vacation (otherwise they'll hear about it secondhand through a friend or other means)

ADDENDUM
- plan for your new org's attributes: get stuff done or high quality stability or resilience (departures) or "max lean" or will grow in the future?
- do you need as many managers? how will new reporting structures or team chemistry work out?
- be cautious about any lists or plans - early sharing can lead to rapid uninformed decicions and a rock rolling down hill
- when you have your list: get HR's answers on how to treat with compassion: parental leave, visa, other specific situations

EXECUTION
- understand the new org structure
- including connections to other teams and depts
- what responsibilities have to transition
- especially passwords and creds? external contacts?
- have your messaging from HR, have personal nuance for each person (still approved by HR)
- stay on script: be empathetic but don't argue or explain
- - this is about them, not you!
- offer (if you mean it) to assist in the job search
- HR will take over the logistics (that's usually "the end")
- who else is a flight risk? mitigations?

Followup meeting with the whole company, then with the dept, then with teams, the with ICs: be available
- have your FAQs and script
- tell the truth: be honest but kind
- the truth sometimes is "I can't share that" or "this is not the time to discuss that"
- be prepared for shock, anger, grief
- there may be unexpected or abnormal behavior - consider what's allowable vs always unacceptable
- there will be no more work that day

The week(s) after will be more hard conversations; your job is to steer people to look ahead, re-engage
- don't fall into the trap of explaining too many times or "what if" or arguing the decisions

Have the new Org chart, and explain it
