I couldn't delete a folder in FTP (which can be pretty frustrating)
until I realized that Filezilla has an option to "force showing hidden
files"

</p>

In Filezilla 3 = Server -\> Force showing hidden files

</p>

I could then see the .htaccess file and delete it.

(Right click on a folder/file and File Attributes shows me the
permissions e.g. Read / Write / Execute)...
