Title: Windows Programming in WinCE on-an HP IPAQ: 365 programming project day twenty three

Date: 2010-01-23 13:26

As the number of portable computers (we might call them mobile phones or smart phones or pda's etc.) explodes they need software. 

One thing Microsoft got right is that Windows CE, the stripped down version of Windows for Mobile Devices, uses most of the same basic programming platform/language as "normal" desktop windows programming. 

The following is a very interesting learning experience I've had (and a useful way to pass otherwise idle waiting time in the "Tube") programming Windows Applications in WinCE.

- - -
The first thing you need is a WinCE compiler - my choice was pocketgcc (even though it hasn't been updated since 2003), because a port of GCC to WinCE means a stable tool that I already know (sorta) how to use. http://pocketgcc.sourceforge.net/ http://kittyandbear.net/john/c-programming-guides/pocketgcc.zip The next hurdle after downloading and copying them onto my device (HP Ipaq) and double tapping (clicking) to install them was to use the CMD to cd \pgcc 
- - -

Then I used a text editor (either Word or pocketnotepad) to create a batch file (yes, technically I suppose a batch file is a program too!) with the following cryptic lines... 

'''
\pgcc\cc1plus \pgcc\source-code.txt -o \pgcc\cwms.s -I \pgcc\include -include \pgcc\fixincl.h -fms-extensions \pgcc\as \pgcc\cwms.s -o \pgcc\cwmo.o \pgcc\ld \pgcc\cwmo.o -o \pgcc\cwme.exe -L \pgcc\lib -l cpplib -l corelibc -l coredll -l aygshell -l runtime -l portlib 
'''

The cc1plus.exe (compiler?) outputs the assembly code file but also includes the "fixincl.h" file and use the -fms-extensions option (no, I haven't actually yet learned exactly why). 

The as.exe program turns the assembly into object code. 

Finally the loader turns the object code into an executable with the appropriate libraries. 

The following source code should look very familiar to my earlier Windows Programming examples. 

I've added comments here that are not in my "production" IPAQ environment source code because the screen is too small with lots of scrolling already...

doesn't work without them and I figure they must be specific to WinCE */

all before main() ... but of course I have to remember to always declare
before using... so do as I say: always declare functions (and then remember
to update them and the stub), not as I do... */
