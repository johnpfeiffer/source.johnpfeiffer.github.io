Socrates oral questions (and answers) were immortalized by Plato's writings.

I love books, the distillation of the wisdom of the ages, and the
libraries where they are enshrined and shared. Visiting a library is an
exciting insight into the culture and values of a location.

Encyclopedias, Dictionaries, and all manner of reference books were the
compendium of answers; questions had to be researched (sometimes
involving extensive legwork, detective work, and persistence).

Digitization of books (e.g. encyclopedia on cd-rom) enabled huge
improvement in the access and distribution of information.

Physical bulletin boards and community centers are also places of
information exchange; digital communication (modems!) transformed the reach and capacity.

Television and Video, despite many attempts, has long remained a one way medium. (Though too there's something inherently relaxing about passive entertainment).

The Internet (and especially Google search) means specialist websites
and esoteric questions are a couple links away; it has also enabled
crowd sourcing answers.

I'm amazed at the speed and accuracy of answers aggregated by Wikipedia,
StackExchange, Quora, etc. (which admittedly still require filtering and research for correctness and comprehension).

It's gotten so that now I receive answers to questions which I didn't
realize I had!
