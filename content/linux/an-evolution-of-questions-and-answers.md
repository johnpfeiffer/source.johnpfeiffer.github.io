Socrates oral questions (and answers) were immortalized by Plato's
writings.

</p>

I love books, the distillation of the wisdom of the ages, and the
libraries where they are enshrined and shared. Visiting a library is an
exciting insight into the culture and values of a location.

</p>

Encyclopedias, Dictionaries, and all manner of reference books were the
compendium of answers; questions had to be researched (sometimes
involving extensive legwork, detective work, and persistence).

</p>

Digitization of books (e.g. encyclopedia on cd-rom) enabled huge
improvement in the access and distribution of information.

</p>

Physical bulletin boards and community centers are also places of
information exchange; digital communication (modems!) transformed the
reach and capacity.

</p>

Television and Video, despite many attempts, has long remained a one way
medium. (Though too there's something inherently relaxing about passive
entertainment).

</p>

The Internet (and especially Google search) means specialist websites
and esoteric questions are a couple links away; it has also enabled
crowd sourcing answers.

</p>

I'm amazed at the speed and accuracy of answers aggregated by Wikipedia,
StackExchange, Quora, etc. (which admittedly still require filtering and
research for correctness and comprehension).

</p>

It's gotten so that now I receive answers to questions which I didn't
realize I had.
