First put oil in a pan and heat it (we use \#3 of 6 on our electric
stove). Then beat/whip two or three eggs in a bowl, then take slices of
bread and dip them in the whipped eggs (or you can soak them if you want
them more egg full) and put them on the frying pan to fry.

</p>

The medium heat should cook the egg slowly (too hot and the egg turns
white/yellow like fried eggs on bread), after about 5-10 minutes? (peek
underneath and check if they're golden brown) you flip them and cook the
other side.

</p>

I sometimes add my secret ingredient, a slice of butter on top to melt,
after flipping them over.

</p>

When done you can have them with one of the following yummy toppings:  

soft cream cheese (Philadelphia cream cheese)  

kashkaval or mozarella and honey  

jam (raspberry/blueberry/strawberry you name it!)  

helva

</p>

To quote Bobby "Filiki are divine!" or "Helva na filiki e strahotno".
