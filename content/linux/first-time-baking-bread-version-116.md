I can cook pancakes, cookies, and cake even... from the pre-made mixes.
Just add water, eggs,stir, heat in oven, eat...

</p>

I've tried making pancakes from scratch (next time I'll post the recipe)
with ok results.

</p>

My first "bread" attempt didn't actually make dough that you can roll so
I'm not sure if it was bread...

</p>

Mix the following in a bowl:

</p>

3 glasses of flour (plain, none of that fancy already mixed stuff for
me!)  

1 glass of sugar (granular cane sugar is all I had)  

3 tsp of baking soda  

4 tsp of salt

</p>

Beat the following into a different bowl  

2 eggs  

1 cup of milk

</p>

Then stir the two bowls together until mostly smooth.  

Smear cooking oil in the bottom of a pan (mine was 1/2" by 7" by 9") to
prevent sticking.  

Pour the mixture into the pan (not really dough, eh?)

</p>

Then I melted enough butter to put a tiny layer on top of everything in
the pan (note there was lots of leftover "dough" for a second time on
the pan).

</p>

Baked at 200 degrees celsius for about 15 minutes then set to cool for
another 10 minutes.

</p>

VERDICT:  

Light and ok for fluffiness. Good crust. Definitely too much baking soda
but with apricot jam spread tastes fine. Serves 2-3 (or me over one
day).  

Good things: oil on the pan, butter on top, sugar is IMPORTANT.

</p>

NEXT TIME I will try halving all of the ingredients, reducing the soda
by yet another half tsp, and maybe some more sugar or vanilla/cinnamon.

</p>

\*LEGEND  

1 small glass = about 200 ml ... is that a cup? (not quite 236ml...)  

ml = milliliter, tsp= teaspoon
