The well known perceived future business model is constant (mobile)
targeted (user profiling) advertising (everywhere) with instant purchase
(online + mobile) and delivery (streaming)

</p>

So Apple (Android) + Facebook + Google + Amazon + (Netflix?)

</p>

I think there's more to think about: the infrastructure is the gold;
Hardware Manufacturers (CPU + RAM + SSD), Servers, Routers, ISP's,
Content Producers, Transaction Processing, Data & User Platforms.

</p>

The new ecosystem is inherently more distributed (more users globally,
more devices) and fragmented (more OS, Apps, Content Producers, etc.)
than the "Microsoft Era".

</p>

Complexity increases with more data to aggregate/index/filter and many
smaller transactions: consider previously purchasing a single desktop,
monitor, (Windows bundled with it) and MS Word + one or two apps
(Quickbooks or Photoshop).

</p>

Now it's a laptop + phone + tablet (Windows + Android + iOS), each with
many apps (including online services like Facebook) and the challenge of
maintaining a consistent view of security, data, and even application
state.

</p>

Business purchases used to be larger, even grouped for volume (i.e. a
company orders 1,000 desktops + monitors at $1,500 a piece); now it's
bring your own device ($500) and many small app and content purchases
for 99 cents to $10.

</p>

Companies that solve the multi platform and scalability problems (along
with of course actually creating a product that fulfills a need or
desire) will get bigger faster.

</p>

The opportunities are growing exponentially (network effect) for the
talented, hard working teams that can execute.
