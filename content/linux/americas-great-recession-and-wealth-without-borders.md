Why do countries like Germany and Japan have such a high quality of life
AND high productivity? Remember that their unemployed have free medical
care, education, and unemployment benefits.

</p>

Are they just smarter than Americans?

</p>

"The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty examined tax returns
from 1913 to 2008. They discovered an interesting pattern. In the late
1970s, the richest 1 percent of American families took in about 9
percent of the nationâ€™s total income; by 2007, the top 1 percent took in
23.5 percent of total income."

</p>

Lower income taxes encourages risk taking and short term me first now
gains.

</p>

Higher income taxes motivates creating methods of long term wealth
accrual, e.g. business with continual steady profits.

</p>

Corporations and Wealthy Individuals do not have geographic or political
boundaries. It is the mainstream and poor of a society that cannot
simply pack up and move some place sunnier with low taxes (Monaco). So
don't worry about the "wealth moving away because of high taxes"... it's
already done so (e.g. Microsoft Ireland and Offshore bank accounts etc.)

</p>

What's left? Businesses and Organizations that bring people together and
give them a common purpose. They receive money for their time and work
which is then spent in the local economies; aka the Exponential Spending
Effect of capitalism (as opposed to the failed Trickle Down Economic
Policy).

</p>

There's a lie that "businesses are made for profit" - If you own and
work in a business (the quintessential small business) and you pay your
employees, suppliers, contractors regularly and you receive a salary of
$100,000 but your business doesn't show a profit... You can still have a
wonderful life and everyone in that interconnected ecology is healthy
and stable. In fact, you're even contributing to the mythical GDP.

</p>

Yet if policemen, firemen, nurses, teachers, etc. aren't able to work
and spend then the quality of life for everyone will degrade into
misery. The wealth gap will drive a America's great experiment, a
Democratic Capitalist Republic, into Depression and Oligarchy...

</p>

Enrich your mind: Your vote makes a difference!
