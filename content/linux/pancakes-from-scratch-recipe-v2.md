You're hungry, you want something "home cooked", and you have the
following:

</p>

1 egg  

1.5 cups of flour  

.5 cup of sugar  

1 pinch of baking soda  

1 tsp of salt  

3 tsp of melted butter  

At least 2 cups of Milk (or water)

</p>

Stir and then pour in enough milk, while beating vigorously, until the
mixture is smooth enough to pour.

</p>

Try not to leave any flour unmixed into the batter.

</p>

Hot frying pan (with oil in the bottom) for about 5 mins a side
(hopefully you'll have a hotter frying pan/cooker and it will take less
time).

</p>

Usually you flip when the bottom is golden brown (you'll notice bubbles
start appearing in the cooking batter.

</p>

Shapes of hearts, letters, and animals are recommended.

</p>

Possible spreads (separate or altogether): Jam, chocolate, honey, cheese
with honey, philadelphia cream cheese, feta cheese, fruits, peanut
butter, ?
