I turned my website offline for maintenance and then logged out (or
wanted to work on it from another computer).

</p>

All I got was the **"Site is offline for maintenance message".**

</p>

The Solution:

</p>

Type the following address into your browser:  
[http://yourwebsite.com/?=user][]

</p>

This will take you to the user login prompt - if you are the
Administrator user you can then turn the site back online.
