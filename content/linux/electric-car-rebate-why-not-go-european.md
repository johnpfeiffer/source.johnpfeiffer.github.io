The price of petrol in London is about 116 pence per liter
[http://www.whatprice.co.uk/petrol-prices/][]  

1 US gallon = 3.78 liter  

4.39 GBP (pounds) per gallon  

1 pound = 1.5 dollars (exchange rates are always crazy)  

6.59 dollars per gallon

</p>

miles driven / mpg ... -\> total cost of gasoline?  

195k / 49.5 = 3939.40 \* $6.59 = $25,960 (hybrid)  

195k / 30 = 6500 \* $6.59 = $42,835 (fuel efficient car)  

195k / 15 = 13000 \* $6.59 = $85,670 (normal/big car)

</p>

So, while many will argue that "Europeans" are "controlling their oil
consumption" through taxes, I would argue that the world has been
susidizing the oil industry. Additionally, many American vehicles get 20
or even 15 mpg.

PLEASE REMEMBER, money is fiction (pieces of paper), work is economic
fiction, government is fiction, and the price of Gas/Fossil Fuels is
fiction. We all agree to a system but the system can and should be
changed towards improvement.

So perhaps instead of silly rebates we should reduce Fossil Fuel
susbidies and increase the tax on gas (yes, there are both Federal and
State taxes on gas already so I'm not proposing some radical communist
ideology).
