The Magical Million scratch card scam...

</p>

Magazines and newspapers get money from advertisers, some of which run
contests and promotions.

</p>

I was not surprised to see that Rupert Murdoch's "Times" had scratch
cards for the Magical Million from PurelyCreative.com

</p>

Considering the fake news from Fox, it's no surprise there's a long
standing fake contest advertised in Murdoch's paper.

</p>

A scatch card says "3 identical symbols - you can claim a GUARANTEED
CASH PAYOUT".

</p>

So our three helicopters... by calling the £1.50 per minute premium
number (or premium text messages) you can find out how much you've
won... which you then send by post (including a return stamp) and wait
months. When you chase them up many times in many months you might
receive your £10 award (in vouchers?!?!), or then again you might not.

</p>

Greed. Something for nothing. You're luckier than everyone else...

</p>

If you are silly enough to insist on "playing" (because you already are
a winner), then hopefully you'll recycle the scratch card and go buy a
lottery ticket.

</p>

Consider that £9 buys a lot of fun for a homeless person in your
neighborhood, or supports your local charity (RSPCA, Red Cross, etc.)

</p>

These companies are the lowest level of legal scam possible (eventually
they graduate into selling derivatives, junk bonds, or insurance); if
you are using a computer and the internet to read about this scam then
you should be too smart to fall for it.
